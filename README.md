## gvim Launcher

### Introduction
This small utility provides the means to replace Notepad.exe on Windows with vim.

It is based on grumpydev's excelent [Sublime-Notepad-Replacement](https://github.com/grumpydev/Sublime-Notepad-Replacement)

### Installation

* Download the ZIP file from the [ZIP folder](https://github.com/etheralm/Gvim-Notepad-Replacement/tree/master/zip).
* Extract the three files in the ZIP (SublimeLauncher.exe, ReplaceNotepad.bat and RevertNotepadRedirection.bat) to the same directory as Sublime Text itself.
* Run ReplaceNotepad.bat. You will need to "Run as Administrator" if using Vista/Win7/Win8.

Now when the system wants to launch Notepad it will launch gvim instead.

Enjoy!

### Uninstallation
* If you ever want to revert changes and return to Notepad, run RevertNotepadRedirection.bat.
